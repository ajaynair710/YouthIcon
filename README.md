- Let's put **Asia, Europe, North America, South America and Australia** on NLP map. A living collection of NLP projects for Asians, by Asians.

**YouthIcon** is an research effort for NLP for Asian languages that is OPEN SOURCE, CONTINENT-WIDE, DISTRIBUTED and ONLINE. This GitHub repository will house the data, code, results and research for building open baseline NLP results for Asian languages.

## Goals
- **For Asia**: To build and facilitate a community of NLP researchers, connect and grow it, spurring and sharing further research, build helpful tools for applications in government, medicine, science and education, to enable language preservation and increase its global visibility and relevance. 

- **For NLP Research**: To build data sets and tools to facilitate NLP research on Asian languages, and to pose new research problems to enrich the NLP research landscape.

- **For the global researchers community**: To discover best practices for distributed research, to be applied by other emerging research communities.

## How can I contribute?

There are many ways to contribute to **YouthIcons**.

1. **TRAIN A MODEL** - Contribute a trained model and related code for your language
2. **ANALYSIS** - Contribute analysis of data/models for any languages. You do not need any technical experience for this! If you're a linguist, we can pair you up with a machine translation practitioner and you can help contribute analysis
3. **DATA** - Help build or find datasets for your language
4. **DOCUMENTATION** - Help document our discussions, progress. This is VERY much needed. Or contribute to documentation of the base "notebook" that will improve the experience of others
5. **MENTORSHIP** - Provide advice or help tune models for their languages and datasets, or help people get started
6. **ADMIN** - Working with so many researchers can be quite a challenge! Help out with administrative tasks
7. **COMPUTE** - Help with infrastructure and compute! Do you have spare compute to donate? Let us know! We're always looking for more.
9. **STORY-TELLING** - Tell our stories to the world by doing talks about the community, or engaging with media outlets
10. **MLOps & ML Engineering** - Do you enjoy delving into the MLOps side of machine learning? Are you a software developer looking to hone-in on your ML engineer abilities? Join us to help build tools to support out reproducability, data gathering, and model sharing!
